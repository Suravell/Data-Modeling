# Data-Modeling

This project demonstrates the seamless integration between PostgreSQL, psycopg2, and pandas for efficient data loading and structuring. We create a PostgreSQL database, import data from CSV files using pandas, and interact with the database to structure tables. Finally, we insert the data into the PostgreSQL tables using psycopg2. Follow along with the code to enhance your understanding of these processes.
